# face_detection_with_coordinate
A project that uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time, calculate their coordinates in 3D space, and display them on screen.
## Features
- Detects multiple faces in real-time.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Calculates the x, y, z coordinates of each face in the 3D space.
- Displays coordinates on screen.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-with-coordinates.git
